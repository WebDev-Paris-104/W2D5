- Copy the link to your repository.

Now in your terminal, use `cd` to go were you would like to have your files for your project and than in the terminal write `git clone the-link-you-just-copied`

There you go !

Now try to create an `index.html` file, use `git add` to track it, `git commit -m "first commit"` to stage it, `git push` to well, push it online !
